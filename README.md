# STUDENT-ENGAGEMENT-USING-EXCEL-AND-STATISTICS
## PROJECT OBJECTIVE
 An Edu-Tech company wanted to increase student engagement on their platform, so they introduced various additional features. These included an XP system that enabled students to track their progress, level up, and earn rewards by completing various learning objectives. The platform also offered in-app coins that could be exchanged for special awards, a leaderboard where students could compete for top positions in different divisions—earning weekly rewards and advancing up the ladder—and streaks to motivate students to maintain consistent learning habits.Now, the company wants to determine whether student engagement increased separately for free and paid students between Q4 2021 and Q4 2022, during the period when these features were introduced.
